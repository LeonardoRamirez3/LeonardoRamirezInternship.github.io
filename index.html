						<h2>ACES Engineering and Architecture Internship</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The internship I was part of was rebuilding and remodeling LAUSD Elementary Schools during the summer in order for them to be ready when students returned. I am incredibly glad I was able to apply and get the internship as it was an amazing learning experience.</p>

						<h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I was under the supervision of the OAR of the project, Mr. Sergua Pirali, who taught me a range of different lessons on blueprint reading as well as identifying and problem-solving issues within the plans and in the field. I accompanied him and his collegues during walks around the worksite as well as offer any input towards the problem solving stages of the project.</p>

						<h2>What I Learned</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Having this experience helped me understand more in depth how the professional working environment works. Furthermore, there were various meetings everyday that demonstrated the working dynamic and the language used. Mr. Pirali also took a huge part in my progress in learning how to read blueprints, explaining how there were various blueprints with varying purposes from showing the electric to the mechanical aspect of the blueprints. Furthermore, I learned how to scan the blueprint and keep it in mind while doing the walks to correlate the construction to the drawings.</p>
